For a limited amount of time ECMLPKDD'17 papers were available for download from [http://ecmlpkdd2017.ijs.si/program.html/](http://ecmlpkdd2017.ijs.si/program.html/).

I used this opportunity to crawl all the papers before they were published.
The python code uses the <tt>scrapy</tt> package.

This was my first experiment with <tt>scrapy</tt> package, so <b>don't judge</b>!
